[Deep Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking) is the use of a hyperlink that links to specific web content. In the context of mobile apps, a deep link is a uniform resource identifier (URI) that takes a user to a specific location within an app, rather than simply launching the app.
For example, the URI [https://open.spotify.com/show/2cKdcxETn7jDp7uJCwqmSE?si=T8L710wjTJisZ8fL1BD9iw](https://open.spotify.com/show/2cKdcxETn7jDp7uJCwqmSE?si=T8L710wjTJisZ8fL1BD9iw) is a link that takes you directly to the *"Go Time FM"* podcast in your spotify app.

This app is a *deep link* launcher.
